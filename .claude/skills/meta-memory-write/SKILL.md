# Memory Write

Saves durable facts to `context/MEMORY.md` — the curated working scratchpad that gets read at session start as a frozen snapshot.

## Outcome

- A durable fact is added to, updated in, or removed from `context/MEMORY.md`
- Character cap (2,500) is enforced — consolidation happens before the cap is breached
- Confirmation message shown: `Saved — will be active from next session.`
- `context/MEMORY.md` exists with the three-section scaffold if it was missing

## Context Needs

| File | Load level | How it shapes this skill |
|------|-----------|--------------------------|
| `context/MEMORY.md` | Full | The file being written to — must be read before every action to dedup and check the cap |

If the file doesn't exist, create it with the standard scaffold before writing.

---

## Step 1: Determine Action

Parse the user's request into one of three actions:

| User phrasing | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| "remember this", "note that", "save this", "log this", "add to memory" | **add** |
| "update memory about X", "change the X entry", "X is now Y" | **replace** |
| "forget about X", "remove X from memory", "delete the X entry" | **remove** |

If ambiguous, ask before proceeding.

---

## Step 2: Read MEMORY.md

Read `context/MEMORY.md` in full. If it doesn't exist, create it with this scaffold:

```markdown
<!-- Cap: 2,500 chars. Curated working scratchpad. Maintained by meta-memory-write skill. Mid-session writes take effect on the next session (frozen snapshot pattern). -->
# Working Memory

## Active Threads

## Environment Notes

## Pending Decisions
```

---

## Step 3: Pick Target Section

Decide which section the fact belongs in:

| Section | Use for |
|---------|---------|
| `## Active Threads` | Current work, open questions, things to revisit |
| `## Environment Notes` | URLs (staging, prod), tool versions, project structure, config file locations |
| `## Pending Decisions` | Decisions waiting on input, options still under consideration |

If the fact doesn't fit any of the three, ask the user where it belongs rather than creating a new section. Sections are intentionally limited to keep the scratchpad focused.

---

## Step 4: Dedup Check

Scan the file for substring matches against the new fact:

- **Exact match exists** → skip the write, tell the user the fact is already saved
- **Similar entry exists** → prefer **replace** over **add**, even if the user said "remember this"
- **No match** → proceed to cap check

---

## Step 5: Cap Check

Compute current byte count of `context/MEMORY.md`.

- **Bash:** `wc -c < context/MEMORY.md`
- **PowerShell:** `(Get-Item context/MEMORY.md).Length`

If adding the new fact would push the file over **2,500 characters**:

1. Consolidate existing entries:
   - Merge similar lines under the same section
   - Remove threads that are clearly resolved (look for "done", "shipped", "closed" markers)
   - Tighten verbose entries into single-line facts
2. Re-check the count
3. If still over after consolidation, tell the user: "MEMORY.md is full. Which entry should I drop to make room for `{new fact}`?"

---

## Step 6: Write the Change

Apply the action using the Edit tool with precise old_string/new_string:

- **add** → insert under the target section heading. Use a bullet (`- `) prefix. Keep to one line per fact.
- **replace** → swap the matched substring with the new value.
- **remove** → **first show the user the exact line and ask "Remove this?"** Only delete after explicit confirmation.

Never store secret values — only reference names (e.g., `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY in .env`, not the key itself).

---

## Step 7: Confirm

After the write succeeds, reply with exactly:

```
Saved — will be active from next session.
```

If the action was **remove**, reply: `Removed — will be active from next session.`

If the dedup check caused a skip, reply: `Already saved — no change needed.`

---

## Rules

*Updated automatically when the user flags issues. Read before every run.*

- Never exceed 2,500 characters in `context/MEMORY.md`. Consolidate first; if that fails, ask the user what to drop.
- Always check for duplicates before adding. Substring match across the whole file.
- Prefer **replace** over **add** when updating an existing fact.
- Never quote secret values in MEMORY.md — reference env var names only.
- Always confirm with the user before **remove** — show the exact line being deleted.
- Mid-session writes persist to disk but only take effect on the next session. Tell the user this in the confirmation message so they understand why.
- Do not create new sections beyond Active Threads / Environment Notes / Pending Decisions. If a fact doesn't fit, ask the user where it belongs.

---

## Self-Update

If the user flags an issue with how memory is written — wrong section, missed dedup, bad consolidation — update the `## Rules` section in this SKILL.md immediately with the correction and today's date. Don't just log it to learnings; fix the skill so it doesn't repeat the mistake.

---

## Graceful Degradation

- **MEMORY.md missing** → create with the standard scaffold, then write
- **MEMORY.md corrupted or malformed** → ask the user before doing anything destructive
- **Ambiguous section target** → ask the user; don't guess
- **Bash `wc -c` not available (rare on Windows)** → fall back to PowerShell length check
