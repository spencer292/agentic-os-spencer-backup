# Image Generation — Interactive Visual Direction

Generate images using GPT Image 2 or Gemini 3 Pro Image. The skill's value is in the **visual direction experience** — guiding users through the 6-Element Framework to make intentional creative decisions before constructing model-specific prompts.


## Paths

Read `skill-pack/config/sys-config.md` → `## Paths` section before any path-dependent step. It resolves `{decoupled_base}`, `{env_file}`, `{brand_context}`, and `{projects_base}` to absolute paths set by the installer. Substitute these placeholders wherever they appear below.

## Context Needs

| File | Load level | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `context/learnings.md` | `## viz-image-gen` section | Apply previous feedback |
| `references/icons/README.md` | On any icon request | CDN source chain (Simple Icons, Lobehub, Devicon) + URL patterns + naming convention |

No brand_context files needed. This skill produces visuals, not branded copy.

## Icon resolution — STOP trying to draw icons inline

When a composition references an icon by name (e.g., `{ type: vector, subtype: svg-icon, name: "flame" }`), **DO NOT** draw it with `<svg><circle/path/>` inline. Use the resolver script:

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/viz-image-gen/scripts/fetch_icon.py \
  --name flame \
  --brand-context brand_context \
  --color "#E25A45"
```

Resolution chain (stops at first hit, all deterministic — no AI):

1. `brand_context/visual-identity/icons/{name}.svg` (brand override / cache)
2. `viz-image-gen/references/icons/commons/**/{name}.svg` (curated, 58+ icons)
3. **Simple Icons** CDN (CC0, ~3,300 brand icons) — `https://cdn.simpleicons.org/{name}` or `/{name}/{hex}`
4. **Lobehub Icons** CDN (MIT, AI tools) — `cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@lobehub/icons-static-svg@latest/icons/{name}.svg`
5. **Devicon** CDN (MIT, dev tools / IDEs) — `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/{name}/{name}-{variant}.svg`

Full URL patterns + naming conventions: `references/icons/README.md`. The script reads from there.

CDN-fetched SVGs are CACHED to `brand_context/visual-identity/icons/{name}.svg` automatically — subsequent runs hit local cache.

**If the resolver returns "not found in any source" (exit 2):**

1. **Don't trust your first name guess.** The resolver requires an EXACT filename match (no fuzzy matching). Before escalating, `ls` the local commons (`.claude/skills/viz-image-gen/references/icons/commons/`) to see what's actually there, and try 3–5 alternative names that match what's on disk (e.g., "sunburst-8pt" exists but "sunburst" does not; "pen-01" exists but "pen" does not).
2. **Triage by shape type, not just name.** The CDNs (Simple Icons, Lobehub, Devicon) are **brand-logo-focused** — they will NEVER return generic geometric shapes (scalloped badges, sunbursts, callout frames, ribbons, abstract decorations). For those, skip the CDN round entirely and decide between:
   - **Inline SVG** — preferred for primitive geometric shapes (badges, bursts, frames, decorative borders). Deterministic, vector-perfect, scales infinitely, mathematically symmetric. Write the `<path>` directly.
   - **AI generation** — only when the shape carries texture, illustration, or organic/painterly qualities that SVG can't express.
3. **Only escalate to `subtype: ai-illustration` after both steps above.** Drawing branded/known icons inline as `<svg><circle/>` is a bug — it signals you skipped the resolver. But drawing a primitive geometric shape inline as SVG is the *correct* answer when the resolver legitimately has nothing.

## Dependencies

| Skill | Required? | What it provides | Without it |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| `str-trending-research` | Optional | Researches prompt techniques, visual styles, and model-specific patterns for unfamiliar styles | Fall back to built-in reference files only |
| `tool-web-screenshot` | Optional | Captures a live web page as a source image for annotation, reference, or composition | User must provide their own screenshot/image |
| `tool-video-screenshots` | Optional | Extracts key frames from a video as source images for annotation or reference | User must provide their own screenshot/image |
| `tool-screenshot-annotator` | Optional | Pixel-perfect programmatic annotations (numbered circles, highlight boxes) on real images | Falls back to GPT/Gemini image editing with source modification risk |
| `viz-excalidraw-diagram` | Optional | Excalidraw JSON diagrams rendered to PNG via Playwright | Falls back to GPT/Gemini diagram generation with no JSON source |

## Step 0: Check API Keys

Check which backends are available:

- **GPT:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `{env_file}` — from https://platform.openai.com/
- **Gemini:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `{env_file}` — free at https://ai.google.dev/

At least one must be set. If both are available, recommend per Step 4. If only one is available, use that one and note the limitation.

## Step 1: Read Learnings

Read `context/learnings.md` → `## viz-image-gen` for previous feedback on styles, prompt patterns, or quality issues.

## Step 2: Understand & Guide

This is the interactive heart of the skill. Detect the user's clarity level and adapt.

### Quick Mode (skip to Step 3)

Activate when the user provides:
- A detailed description with clear visual intent
- An explicit style reference ("cinematic Blade Runner style")
- A specific preset name ("use the UGC influencer style")

→ Move directly to building the Visual Breakdown.

### Guided Mode

Activate when the request is vague or open-ended ("image of a desk setup", "something for my social media"). Ask smart questions based on image type:

**1. Source & reference check:**
> "Are we working from something real (a web page, a video, an existing screenshot) or creating from scratch?"
- **From a URL:** Use `tool-web-screenshot` to capture the page, then use it as `--input-image` for annotation/composition
- **From a video:** Use `tool-video-screenshots` to extract key frames, then use as `--input-image`
- **From an existing file:** User provides the path directly
- **From scratch:** Pure generation — continue to style questions
- **Style reference only:** Analyse it through the 6-Element Framework (see Reference Image Analysis below)

**Product Shoot Mode** — activate when the user provides a product image and wants multiple consistent shots (e.g. "hero shot and lifestyle", "product shoot", "4 product shots", "all angles"):
1. Read `references/style-product-shoot.md` for the full workflow
2. Analyse the reference image and build a **Product Lock Description**
3. Present the shot list (Hero, Detail, Flat Lay, Lifestyle, Group, Unboxing) — user picks which
4. Generate each shot individually with the Product Lock prepended and reference image as `--input-image`
5. Offer grid composite after all shots are done
6. Skip the rest of Guided Mode — Product Shoot Mode has its own framework presets per shot type

**2. Style direction** (present 3-4 options relevant to their subject):
> "What vibe are you going for?"
> - [Option A — brief, concrete description]
> - [Option B — brief, concrete description]
> - [Option C — brief, concrete description]
> - Something else — describe it

**3. Framing** (if not obvious from context):
> "How should this be framed?"
> - Close-up detail shot
> - Medium shot (waist-up for people)
> - Wide environmental shot
> - [Other relevant option for their subject]

**4. Multi-generation offer:**
> "Do you want to compare multiple directions? I can generate 2-3 variations."

Keep it conversational — 2-3 questions max per round. Don't interrogate. Use what you can infer and confirm.

### Reference Image Analysis

When the user provides a reference image:
1. Analyse it through the 6 elements
2. Present the breakdown back:
> "I see: [subject], [framing], [lighting], [mood], [medium], [style] — should I match this closely or use it as a starting point?"
3. Use their answer to set framework parameters

## Step 3: Build Visual Breakdown

Read `references/visual-framework.md` for the full 6-Element Framework.

Before any prompt is written, construct a **Visual Breakdown** (max 15 lines) documenting all framework decisions:

```
Subject: [what's in the image, specific details]
Framing: [camera angle, distance, lens, aspect ratio]
Lighting: [light setup, direction, quality]
Mood: [emotional tone]
Medium: [physical/digital substrate]
Style: [aesthetic reference]
---
Aspect Ratio: [ratio]
Model: [GPT/Gemini + one-line reasoning]
Key Details: [2-3 specific details that make this unique]
```

**Show this to the user for approval before proceeding.** They can adjust any element. This is the creative direction gate.

If the request maps to a preset style, load the relevant `references/style-*.md` file and use its framework presets as the starting point, adjusting for the specific request.

## Step 4: Model Recommendation

Read `references/model-selection.md` for the full decision matrix. Present the recommendation with reasoning but let the user override:

> "I'd recommend **[Model]** for this — [one-line reason]. Want to go with that, try [other model] instead, or compare both?"

**Quick rules from shootout evidence:**
- **GPT wins:** Close-up realism, hyperreal fantasy, text/typography, instruction following, product labels, macro detail (5/9 tests)
- **Gemini wins:** Cinematic/atmospheric scenes, anime/cel-shaded (artifact-free) (2/9 tests)
- **True ties:** UGC lifestyle, luxury product shots (2/9 tests)

For multi-generation comparison sets: generate the same Visual Breakdown on both backends, or vary the framework choices across generations.

## Step 5: Construct the Prompt

Read the relevant style file from `references/style-*.md` if using a preset. For freeform work, read `references/visual-framework.md` for construction rules.

### Source Image Mode vs From-Scratch Mode

**Critical distinction:** When a source image is provided (screenshot, video frame, user photo, or any existing image), determine the correct route using this decision table:

#### Annotation Routing Decision

| Scenario | Route to | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Real screenshot/video frame + callouts, circles, highlights, numbered annotations | `tool-screenshot-annotator` | Programmatic RGBA overlay — pixel-perfect source preservation guaranteed |
| Real source + artistic hand-drawn annotation explicitly requested (e.g. "red marker circles", "hand-drawn arrows") | `viz-image-gen` with explicit warning | User accepts modification risk — warn first |
| From-scratch technical diagram with annotations | `viz-image-gen` | Pure generation, no source to preserve |
| From-scratch any style | `viz-image-gen` | Pure generation |
| Product reference image + multiple shots requested | Product Shoot Mode (see Step 2) | Consistency workflow, not annotation |

**Route to `tool-screenshot-annotator` (default for real images + annotations):**
1. Capture the source image via `tool-web-screenshot` or `tool-video-screenshots` (or user provides it)
2. Read the captured screenshot to identify what needs annotating — UI elements, key areas, text, buttons
3. Build a `tool-screenshot-annotator` JSON spec with percentage-based coordinates for each annotation (circles at element centers, highlight boxes around regions)
4. Run `tool-screenshot-annotator` to produce the annotated output
5. Source image is preserved perfectly — no AI modification of any pixel

**Route to `viz-image-gen` with warning (artistic annotation on real source):**
1. Before proceeding, tell the user: "GPT/Gemini image editing will modify the base image — faces, text, and details may change. For pixel-perfect annotations, I can use `tool-screenshot-annotator` instead. Want to proceed with AI editing or switch to programmatic annotations?"
2. If user proceeds: apply Source Image Rules below
3. If user switches: follow the `tool-screenshot-annotator` route above

**Source Image Rules (when using viz-image-gen on real sources):**
1. The base image must remain **pixel-perfect unchanged** — all existing people, faces, text, UI elements, layouts, logos, and content stay exactly as they are
2. The prompt must ONLY describe what to **add on top** — annotation layers, markup, callouts, highlights
3. Never instruct the model to "recreate", "enhance", "improve", or "modify" the base image
4. Explicitly state in the prompt: "Do not alter, modify, or regenerate any part of the original image. Keep all existing people, text, and content exactly as they appear. Only add the following overlay annotations..."
5. If the result shows source modification (changed faces, altered text, shifted layout), flag it and re-route to `tool-screenshot-annotator`

**From-Scratch Rules (pure generation):**

Convert the approved Visual Breakdown into a **single dense paragraph** prompt where every framework decision is embedded as specific visual description. Rules:

1. Every element must be represented — no defaults by omission
2. Specificity over adjectives — "neon teal reflecting off wet pavement" not "dramatic lighting"
3. Single flowing paragraph — no bullets, no labels visible to the model
4. 80-250 words of precise visual description

### Model-Specific Prompting Rules

**For GPT** (read `references/prompt-patterns-gpt.md`):
- Use structured labeled segments for complex requests
- Put the most important elements first
- Include intended use case
- For exact text: `Include ONLY this text (verbatim): "X"`
- Spell tricky words letter-by-letter

**For Gemini** (read `references/prompt-patterns-gemini.md`):
- Write narrative, descriptive paragraphs
- Use positive framing: describe what you want, not what to avoid
- Be spatially specific
- Quote exact text in quotation marks

Use `references/modifiers.md` for reliable modifiers organised by framework element.

## Step 6: Generate

### GPT Backend

```bash
uv run ".claude/skills/viz-image-gen/scripts/generate_image_gpt.py" \
  --prompt "FULL CONSTRUCTED PROMPT" \
  --filename "{projects_base}/viz-image-gen/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{descriptive-name}.png" \
  --size 1536x1024 \
  --quality high
```

Options: `--size` (1024x1024/1536x1024/1024x1536/auto), `--quality` (low/medium/high/auto), `--background` (transparent/opaque/auto), `--format` (png/jpeg/webp), `--input-image`/`-i`

### Gemini Backend

```bash
uv run ".claude/skills/viz-image-gen/scripts/generate_image_gemini.py" \
  --prompt "FULL CONSTRUCTED PROMPT" \
  --filename "{projects_base}/viz-image-gen/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{descriptive-name}.png" \
  --resolution 1K \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9
```

Options: `--resolution` (1K/2K/4K), `--aspect-ratio`, `--input-image`/`-i` (up to 14)

**Do NOT read the generated image back.** Report the saved path only.

## Step 7: Save and Report

Save to: `{projects_base}/viz-image-gen/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{descriptive-name}.png`

The script automatically creates a companion `.log.md` file next to the image with the prompt and generation parameters.

Tell the user the full absolute file path so they can view it. Note which backend was used.

## Step 8: Enrich the Generation Log

After generation succeeds, edit the `.log.md` file's `## Reasoning` section:

```markdown
## Reasoning

### Visual Direction
[Quick or Guided mode? What questions were asked? What did the user choose?]

### Framework Decisions
[The Visual Breakdown that was approved]

### Backend Selection
[Why this backend — e.g., "GPT: hyperreal portrait, detail is priority"]

### Style Selection
[Which style preset or freeform approach, and why]

### References Consulted
[Which reference files informed the prompt]

### Research
[If trending research was done, note findings. Otherwise "None — direct prompt construction"]

### Iteration History
[If revision, note what changed. Otherwise "First attempt"]
```

## Step 9: Feedback

Ask: "How does this look? Want to adjust any of the visual direction, try a different style, or generate another variation?"

Log feedback to `context/learnings.md` → `## viz-image-gen` with date and context.

## Rules

*Updated when the user flags issues. Read before every run.*

- **2026-05-06 — Source image preservation:** When annotating over screenshots, video frames, or any existing image, the base image must remain pixel-perfect unchanged. All existing people, faces, text, UI elements, and content must stay exactly as they are. The prompt must ONLY describe overlay annotations to add on top. Always include explicit preservation language: "Do not alter, modify, or regenerate any part of the original image." If faithful preservation cannot be guaranteed, recommend `tool-screenshot-annotator` as a programmatic alternative.
- **2026-05-06 — Annotation routing:** Real screenshots/video frames needing callouts, circles, or highlights must route to `tool-screenshot-annotator` by default (programmatic overlays, zero source modification). Only route to GPT/Gemini editing when the user explicitly requests artistic/hand-drawn annotation style — and warn about modification risk first.
- **2026-05-06 — Product Shoot Mode:** When a user provides a product image and wants multiple shots, activate Product Shoot Mode (Step 2). Build a Product Lock Description from the reference, generate each shot individually with the lock prepended and reference as `--input-image`. Never batch multiple shot types in one prompt.
- **Transparent background requires `gpt-image-1`:** The default `gpt-image-2` model returns HTTP 400 (`Transparent background is not supported for this model`) when `--background transparent` is passed. Whenever a request needs a transparent PNG (icons, badges, logos, stickers, anything that will be overlaid via HTML/CSS), pass `--model gpt-image-1` explicitly to `generate_image_gpt.py`. Sample command: `uv run generate_image_gpt.py --prompt "…" --filename out.png --size 1024x1024 --quality high --background transparent --format png --model gpt-image-1`.
- **Resolver lookup needs exact filename:** `fetch_icon.py` matches the local commons by exact filename (no fuzzy/synonym matching). When a first-guess name returns "not found", `ls` the `commons/` tree first to see real filenames, then re-query — don't loop through synonyms blindly. Also: the CDN tier is brand-logo-focused, so generic geometric shapes (scalloped badges, ribbons, callout frames) will always come back null from CDNs. For those, prefer inline SVG over AI generation (see Icon resolution section). The skill spent an avoidable AI call when a 12-lobe scalloped badge — a primitive geometric shape — was generated via gpt-image-1 instead of as an inline SVG `<path>`.
- **`.env` not auto-loaded by scripts:** `generate_image_gpt.py` reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `os.environ`, not from `.env`. When invoking the script directly from Bash (outside the `render_template.py` pipeline, which calls `load_env_file` itself), export the key first: `export $(grep -E "^OPENAI_API_KEY=" .env | xargs) && uv run generate_image_gpt.py …`. Otherwise the script errors with `No API key provided`.
- **Edit mode (`--input-image`) silently drops `--background transparent`:** OpenAI's `gpt-image-1` routes to two different endpoints based on whether `--input-image` is passed:
  - **No input image** → `/v1/images/generations` → `background: "transparent"` works → returns RGBA PNG.
  - **With input image** → `/v1/images/edits` → the `background` parameter is accepted but NOT honored → returns RGB PNG with a painted neutral grey/checker fill where transparency was requested.

  This is because `/edits` is designed for inpainting via an explicit mask, not for "make the background transparent" via prompt. The model improvises a flat fill instead of leaving alpha=0. **Verified empirically**: same prompt, same flags, same model — without `--input-image` returns mode=RGBA with corner alpha=0; with `--input-image` returns mode=RGB with corner=(127,127,127).

  **When you need extract-from-reference + transparent background, the recommended path** is:

  **Edit mode + contrasting solid bg + rembg chroma-key** — three commands, ~30 seconds, more faithful to the ref than from-scratch generation:

  ```bash
  # 1. Generate with edit mode, prompting for a SOLID HIGH-CONTRAST bg color
  #    (magenta #FF00FF works well — far from white, far from any brand color).
  #    DO NOT pass --background transparent here; edit mode ignores it and adds
  #    cost. The contrasting fill is what rembg keys off.
  uv run generate_image_gpt.py \
    --input-image ref.png \
    --prompt "Extract ONLY the {target shape} from this reference. Output the shape in its original color on a SOLID PURE MAGENTA (#FF00FF) background. Remove everything else. Preserve exact proportions." \
    --filename badge-raw.png --size 1024x1024 --quality high --format png \
    --model gpt-image-1

  # 2. Strip the bg via the existing logo cleaner (uses rembg).
  #    Output is saved as {input-name}-transparent.png next to the input.
  uv run .claude/skills/mkt-visual-identity/scripts/clean_logo_bg.py \
    --input badge-raw.png --output badge.png
  # → produces badge-raw-transparent.png with real RGBA alpha
  ```

  **Why this works**: `clean_logo_bg.py` is `rembg`-based (ML model trained for foreground/background separation). With a 245-RGB-distance gap between bg (magenta) and foreground (white), it nails the cut every time. The opaque_ratio validator inside the script catches over/under-aggressive removals automatically.

  **Tradeoff**: a few pixels of color fringing may remain at the anti-aliased edge (rosy halo on a white-on-magenta source). On a non-white canvas this is invisible. If it matters, post-process: dilate the alpha mask and re-bleach white.

  **Other options** (use when the above doesn't fit):
  1. **Two-step Responses-API**: pass the ref to the Responses API (vision) to get a text description, then call `/generations` (no `--input-image`) with that description + `--background transparent`. Lossy on shape fidelity, but transparency is native.
  2. **Inline SVG**: if the asset is a primitive geometric shape (badge, burst, frame), write the `<path>` directly — see Icon resolution section. Deterministic, vector-perfect, no AI cost.

  When generating from scratch (no reference image needed), prefer `/generations` direct — transparency works first try, see the gpt-image-1 transparent-bg rule above.
