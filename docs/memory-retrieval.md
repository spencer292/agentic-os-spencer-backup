# Memory Retrieval

## How recall works

Tier 1 recall is a three-rung ladder, all served by the scoped PGLite/pgvector store (or hosted Postgres when `MEMORY_DATABASE_URL`/`DATABASE_URL` is set). Each rung is a `memory:recall` invocation from `command-centre/`; stop at the lowest rung that answers the question — never escalate "just in case."

1. **Search** — hybrid retrieval: BGE-M3 vector search plus scoped Postgres full-text keyword search, fused and reranked by source authority and recency.
   ```bash
   npm run memory:recall -- "<query>" --system --json
   ```
   Swap `--system` for `--team <id>` / `--client <slug>` / `--user <id>` depending on whose memory you're answering for (each also includes the `system` baseline). Note the `chunk_id` of the best hit.

2. **Expand** — only if the best hit is too short to answer confidently. Returns the surrounding source context (neighbouring chunks from the same document) around a `chunk_id`.
   ```bash
   npm run memory:recall -- --expand <chunk_id> --system --json
   ```

3. **Transcript** — only if exact wording, a command, or an output is needed and expand wasn't enough. Returns a window of the raw conversation turns behind that chunk.
   ```bash
   npm run memory:recall -- --transcript <chunk_id> --system --json
   ```

Reuse the identical scope flags across all three rungs in one recall — never widen scope mid-ladder.

For an agent, this ladder is driven automatically by the `meta-memory-recall` skill (`.claude/skills/meta-memory-recall/SKILL.md`): it decides when to escalate a rung, enforces the same-scope-flags rule, and applies the citation pattern below. Read that skill for the full step-by-step mechanics; this doc covers what the ladder does and why, not how the skill orchestrates it turn-by-turn.

## Scope and safety

Every memory row carries a visibility: `system` (shared baseline, everyone in the tenant), `team`, `client`, or `private` (one user). A recall only ever sees its own scope plus the `system` baseline — never another client's `client`-scoped memory or another user's `private` memory. See `docs/memory/memory-schema.md` for the full schema and the enforced scope predicate; this is the plain-language version agents and users should rely on day to day.

## Evaluating recall quality (`memory:eval`)

Recall quality and the no-leak boundary are measured by a repeatable harness, not hand-judged. From `command-centre/`:

```bash
npm run memory:eval                    # bge-m3, against the committed gold-set corpus
npm run memory:eval -- --embedder hash # deterministic/offline (FTS + scope don't need the model)
npm run memory:eval -- --json          # machine output (full report + gate)
```

The harness indexes a small committed corpus (`command-centre/src/lib/memory/eval/corpus/`) into an ephemeral store, runs the committed gold-set (`command-centre/src/lib/memory/eval/gold-set.json`) through the real search path, and reports:

- **recall@k and MRR**, split by case `kind` — `exact` (literal filenames/IDs/settings, served by the FTS keyword leg) vs `semantic` (paraphrases with little lexical overlap, served by bge-m3).
- **leak-count** — returned hits that cross a scope they must not. Must be `0`.
- **latency** p50/p95, and a **hybrid-vs-vector-only** rank comparison for exact cases (hybrid should never rank an exact target below vector-only; the keyword leg's *lift* over vector-only only becomes clearly visible on a larger, noisier corpus).

**Gold-set cases** match by `sourcePath` (+ optional `contentIncludes`), never by chunk id, so they survive re-chunking. Add a case by appending `{ id, query, kind, scope, expect, forbid? }` to `gold-set.json`; use `kind: "leak"` (with `forbid`) for a cross-tenant query that must return nothing.

**Gate / exit code.** `memory:eval` exits non-zero when `leak-count` exceeds `thresholds.maxLeaks` or recall falls below a threshold, so it can act as a CI gate. The `exact` and `leak` bars are embedder-independent (deterministic under `--embedder hash`); the `semanticRecallAt5` bar is enforced only under bge-m3 (informational under hash). Wiring it into CI is tracked separately.

## Memsearch status

Memsearch is retired as the active runtime. `memory:recall` rejects `--backend memsearch` outright — the only supported backend is PGLite locally or hosted Postgres. If an install still has old `.memsearch` data, run `bash scripts/setup-memory.sh` to migrate it into the current store.

## Citing sources

Structure every recall response based on what was found:

**Found:** answer + cite source inline ("Based on the session log from 2026-05-11 and a decision in MEMORY.md...") + temporal context ("This was last discussed 3 days ago"). If the source is >14 days old: "Note: this information is from [date] — it may be outdated."

**Partial:** state what you know + what you don't + where you looked + temporal gap ("Last mention of [topic] was [date]. No records since then.") + what might fill the gap.

**Absent:** "I checked MEMORY.md, daily logs back to [earliest date], and ran semantic search across all indexed sources. No mentions of [topic]. If discussed, it may predate capture or occurred in a session that wasn't logged."

For partial or absent responses: run `bash scripts/lib/memory-meta.sh "[topic]"` to get exact coverage before responding.

Auto-captured `.aos.md` files contain summarized per-turn memory, are indexed, and are
tracked for private GitHub backups so memory can be re-chunked and re-embedded later.
Raw transcripts are archived locally under `context/transcripts/` and are the source
the transcript rung drills into. Do not fabricate sources.

## Importing prior Claude Code sessions

Live capture only records sessions from the moment Agentic OS is installed. If you used
Claude Code before, you can backfill that history into the same memory store so recall
works from day one:

```bash
cd command-centre
npm run memory:import-sessions -- --dry-run        # detect + count, no writes
npm run memory:import-sessions                      # interactive menu (source → size → confirm)
```

It is **user-controlled and never silent**: a bare run in a terminal opens a menu, and
`--dry-run` only reports counts. `scripts/setup-memory.sh` / `.ps1` also offer the import
once memory is set up.

- **Sources** — Current workspace sessions (Claude Code's store for this repo), all global
  Claude Code history (`~/.claude/projects/`), existing Agentic OS archives
  (`context/transcripts/`), or an explicit `--source <path>`.
- **Size (newest first)** — `--all`, `--sessions N` (most recent N), `--days N` (past N days),
  or `--since/--until` a date range. The menu offers the same choices.
- **Summaries** — `--summary session` (default; one summary per session), `--summary turn`
  (one block per turn, like live capture), or `--summary none` (raw digest, no LLM).
  Summarization uses your Claude subscription usage, and large histories can take a while —
  importing fewer now and more later is fine.
- **Idempotent** — a small ledger under `.command-centre/memory-import/` plus each block's
  `source:` hash mean re-running never duplicates blocks, sources, or chunks, and
  already-imported sessions are not offered again unless you pass `--force`/`--reimport`.
- **Scope & privacy** — local PGLite imports default to the stable private owner in
  `.command-centre/local-memory-user.json`. Hosted Postgres requires an explicit
  `--visibility`; `system`/`team`/`client` imports additionally require
  `--allow-shared` so
  personal sessions are not silently pushed into a shared scope. Explicit imports
  still honor `--team/--client/--user`. Raw transcripts are only copied (locally,
  gitignored) when you pass `--copy-raw`.
- **When searchable** — the importer writes the memory blocks, then runs the indexer; recall
  finds the imported sessions as soon as indexing completes.
