# Running Agentic OS for Multiple Clients

## The Key Principle

Agentic OS has two layers:

1. **Shared methodology** — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SOUL.md`, skills, scripts. Version-controlled and shared. Lives at the root of your Agentic OS folder.
2. **Client data** — `brand_context/`, memory, learnings, projects, cron jobs, local settings, API keys, client-only skills, and `SKILL.local.md` overrides. Unique per client. Lives inside `clients/{client-name}/`.

Claude remains the primary runtime. The compatibility change is structural:
- `AGENTS.md` is now the canonical shared instruction file
- root `CLAUDE.md` imports `@AGENTS.md` for Claude Code
- each client gets its own `AGENTS.md` for client-specific instructions
- each client also gets a thin `CLAUDE.md` wrapper that imports the local `AGENTS.md`

Everyone starts as a solo operator working from the root folder. When you need a second client, run `add-client.sh` and Agentic OS creates a client workspace with separate context and outputs.

## How the Shared Instructions Load

### Claude Code

Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` files from parent directories. In Agentic OS:

```text
agentic-os/
├── CLAUDE.md                    <- imports root AGENTS.md
├── AGENTS.md                    <- canonical shared methodology
└── clients/
    └── client-one/
        ├── CLAUDE.md            <- imports client AGENTS.md
        ├── AGENTS.md            <- client-specific instructions
        └── ...
```

When you `cd clients/client-one && claude`:
- the root `CLAUDE.md` loads and imports the root `AGENTS.md`
- the client `CLAUDE.md` loads and imports the client `AGENTS.md`
- the result is shared methodology from the root plus client-specific instructions from the client folder

### Codex

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` directly, from the repo root down to the current directory.

When you work inside a client folder with Codex:
- root `AGENTS.md` provides the shared methodology
- client `AGENTS.md` provides the client-specific layer

No extra shim is needed for Codex.

## What's Shared vs What's Separate

| What | Where | How clients get it |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| `AGENTS.md` (shared methodology) | Root | Shared directly from the root |
| `CLAUDE.md` (shared wrapper) | Root | Auto-inherited by Claude Code |
| `context/SOUL.md` | Root | Read by Claude heartbeat fallback |
| `context/USER.md` | Root | Read by Claude heartbeat fallback |
| `.claude/skills/` | Root + each client | Copied on client creation, base skill files auto-sync on update |
| `scripts/` | Root + each client | Copied on client creation, auto-synced on update |
| `.claude/settings.json`, hooks, hook info, cron templates | Root + each client | Shared system files auto-sync on update |
| `AGENTS.md` (client-specific) | Each client | Created by `add-client.sh` |
| `CLAUDE.md` (client wrapper) | Each client | Created by `add-client.sh` |
| `brand_context/` | Each client | Built automatically on first session |
| `context/learnings.md` | Root + each client | Root has system-wide learnings; clients start with a copy and diverge |
| `context/memory/` | Root + each client | Root has system-wide memory; clients keep their own session history |
| `projects/` | Each client | Per-client deliverables |
| `.env` | Each client | Usually copied from root during client creation |
| `cron/jobs/` | Each client | Per-client scheduled tasks |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Each client | Personal client settings, preserved during updates |
| Client-only skills and `SKILL.local.md` | Each client | Client-specific skill additions, preserved during updates |

### What stays in sync automatically

- Shared methodology at the root
- Shared skills, scripts, hooks, settings, and cron templates when you run `update.sh`
- Claude wrappers and client instruction backfills when `update-clients.sh` runs during updates

### What you manage separately

- Brand context
- Learnings
- Session memory
- Projects
- Cron jobs
- API keys if you want client-specific secrets
- Client local settings
- Client-only skills
- `SKILL.local.md` overrides for shared skills

---

## How Skills Stay in Sync

Skills live in the root folder as the master copy. Each client folder gets its own working copy.

This happens automatically in two situations:
1. `add-client.sh` copies the latest skills into the new client folder
2. `update.sh` syncs skills, scripts, settings, hooks, and instruction-file backfills to every client folder

Always edit shared skills at the root level:

```text
Edit here:     agentic-os/.claude/skills/mkt-copywriting/SKILL.md
Not here:      agentic-os/clients/client-one/.claude/skills/mkt-copywriting/SKILL.md
```

Client-only skills are still fine. Create them directly in the client's `.claude/skills/` folder and `update.sh` will preserve them.

Client-specific changes to a shared skill should go in `SKILL.local.md` next to that skill's `SKILL.md`. During updates, Agentic OS replaces the shared base skill files from root but preserves each client's `SKILL.local.md` files and `_catalog/installed.json` skill selection state.

---

## Scenario 1: Solo Operator

```text
~/Projects/agentic-os/
├── AGENTS.md
├── CLAUDE.md
├── context/
├── brand_context/
├── .claude/skills/
├── projects/
├── cron/jobs/
└── .env
```

This is the default setup. You work directly from the root folder.

---

## Scenario 2: Multiple Clients

```text
~/Projects/agentic-os/
├── AGENTS.md
├── CLAUDE.md
├── context/
├── .claude/skills/
├── scripts/
└── clients/
    ├── client-one/
    │   ├── AGENTS.md
    │   ├── CLAUDE.md
    │   ├── .claude/skills/
    │   ├── scripts/
    │   ├── brand_context/
    │   ├── context/
    │   ├── projects/
    │   ├── cron/
    │   └── .env
    └── client-two/
        └── ...
```

### Adding a New Client

```bash
cd ~/Projects/agentic-os
bash scripts/add-client.sh "Client One"
```

This creates `clients/client-one/` with:
- a client `AGENTS.md` for client-specific instructions
- a client `CLAUDE.md` wrapper for Claude Code
- skills and scripts copied from root
- learnings seeded from root
- empty `brand_context/`, `projects/`, and `context/memory/` folders
- a copy of `.env` if one exists at the root

Then start working:

```bash
cd clients/client-one
claude
```

Claude automatically detects it's a new client and walks through the brand foundation.

### What Claude Sees in a Client Folder

When you `cd clients/client-one && claude`:
1. root `CLAUDE.md` loads and imports root `AGENTS.md`
2. client `CLAUDE.md` loads and imports client `AGENTS.md`
3. Claude heartbeat reads `context/SOUL.md` and `context/USER.md` from the root when needed
4. `brand_context/`, `context/memory/`, and `context/learnings.md` come from the client folder
5. `.claude/skills/` comes from the client folder

### What Codex Sees in a Client Folder

When you work in the same folder with Codex:
1. root `AGENTS.md` loads first
2. client `AGENTS.md` loads second
3. the same shared/client layering applies without needing `CLAUDE.md`

---

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/Projects/agentic-os
bash scripts/update.sh
```

That pulls the latest upstream changes and syncs shared client system files from the root, including skills, scripts, hooks, settings, and cron templates.

Updates never overwrite your root or client data. Client context, brand data, memory, projects, cron jobs, `.env`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, client-only skills, and `SKILL.local.md` files are preserved.

Existing clients created before the `AGENTS.md` change are handled conservatively:
- if `AGENTS.md` is missing, `update-clients.sh` seeds it from the old client `CLAUDE.md`
- if the old client `CLAUDE.md` still matches the untouched scaffold, it is replaced with a wrapper automatically
- if the old client `CLAUDE.md` contains custom content, it is preserved and you can clean it up manually later

---

## Sharing API Keys

If all clients use the same API keys:

```bash
cp .env clients/client-two/.env
```

`add-client.sh` already does this automatically when the root `.env` exists.

---

## Cron Across Clients

One managed cron runtime covers the root workspace plus every `clients/*` workspace. Start it once from the workspace root:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/agentic-os
bash scripts/start-crons.sh
```

The Command Centre UI also schedules root and client jobs while the server is running. If the UI and daemon coexist, a shared leader lock in `.command-centre/` ensures only one host schedules jobs at a time.

---

## Rules of Thumb

- Work from the root folder when you are operating for yourself
- Work from `clients/{slug}/` when you are operating for a specific client
- Edit shared methodology in root `AGENTS.md`
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` files as wrappers; do not put the canonical shared rules there
- Edit shared skills at the root
- Let client `AGENTS.md` files hold client-specific instructions
