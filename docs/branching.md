# Branching Policy

`main` is always protected: a PR is required to merge (no direct push), CI status
checks must pass, and no force-pushes or deletions.

`dev` is the working branch. How a change flows depends on its zone:

- **Content** (`projects/`, `brand_context/`, `context/`, `cron/jobs/`,
  `clients/*/`) — commits directly to `dev`.
- **Config** (`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `.env.example`, `scripts/*.sh`) — may commit directly, but a feature branch is
  advised.
- **Code** (`command-centre/src/**`, `.claude/hooks/*.js`, runtime JS/TS) —
  should use a feature branch off `dev`.

**Release:** promote `dev` to `main` via PR (`main` is protected: PR required,
CI must pass, no force-push).

**Solo defaults:** no PR approval required; auto-merge available on release PRs.
Teams can tighten by requiring 1 approval on `main` PRs and disabling auto-merge.
