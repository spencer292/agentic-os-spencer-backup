# Backup & restore hosted team memory

Back up the hosted memory database and restore it after a lost host, a deleted
volume, or a bad migration. The memory store is the team's shared source of
truth, so this is its recovery plan — kept to **two commands** so an operator
never has to remember a long `pg_dump` invocation.

> This guide assumes you have already provisioned hosted Postgres + pgvector,
> wired the `memory:*` commands to it, and seeded it from existing memory (see
> [`hosted-postgres-setup.md`](hosted-postgres-setup.md)). It covers backing that
> database up and getting it back. Cross-references at the end.

## What you get

- One command to back up whichever backend is configured — hosted Postgres or
  local PGLite: `npm run memory:backup`.
- One command to restore from a backup file: `npm run memory:restore -- <file>`.
- A ready-to-run nightly backup job (`cron/jobs/nightly-memory-backup.md`),
  shipped **off** so you can enable it once a destination is in place.

Both commands resolve the active engine through the same rule every memory
command uses (`MEMORY_DATABASE_URL` set → hosted Postgres, else local PGLite), so
you do not pick a strategy — the tool does.

## What's protected, and what's not

A database backup captures **everything inside the memory database**. A private GitHub
backup captures the source files used to rebuild that database, including
`context/memory/*.aos.md` summarized captures.

| Captured by a backup | Not captured (recover another way) |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `memory_sources`, `memory_chunks` (incl. the `vector(1024)` BGE-M3 embeddings) | The source markdown on disk (`context/memory/`, `context/learnings.md`) — lives in private git |
| `index_jobs` (the indexing/queue history) | Secrets / env (`MEMORY_DATABASE_URL`, `MEMORY_API_TOKEN`) — keep these in your secret manager |
| `search_events` (the audit trail of every scoped search) | The hosted host/volume itself — reprovision per [`hosted-postgres-setup.md`](hosted-postgres-setup.md) |
| `schema_migrations` (the applied schema version) | |

This split gives you **two recovery paths** — pick by what you lost:

1. **Regenerable memory (fastest for source-backed memory).** The memory corpus
   (daily logs, `.aos.md` summarized captures, and learnings) is
   derived from files in private git. If that is all you need, you do not even need
   a database backup: reprovision, `npm run memory:migrate`, then
   `npm run memory:reindex` rebuilds it from disk.
2. **Full / non-regenerable recovery.** The `search_events` audit history and any
   database rows created from sources that are not in git cannot be rebuilt by
   re-indexing — they only come back from a database backup. Restore with
   `memory:restore`.

> When in doubt, take database backups. Path 1 is a convenience for the shared
> corpus; path 2 is the real safety net.

## Prerequisites

The Postgres paths use the standard client tools `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`
(`backup`/`restore` of the local PGLite store only needs `tar`). Install them if
missing:

- macOS: `brew install libpq` (then add its `bin` to `PATH`), or `brew install postgresql@16`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install postgresql-client`

The scripts print this hint if the tools are not found.

## Quick start

```bash
cd command-centre

# Back up the configured store → backups/memory/<name>_<timestamp>.dump (or .tar.gz)
MEMORY_DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/agentic_memory' \
  npm run memory:backup

# Restore it (destructive — requires --yes). Into a fresh, empty database:
MEMORY_DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/agentic_memory' \
  npm run memory:restore -- backups/memory/agentic_memory_20260612_031500.dump --yes
```

Without `--yes`, `memory:restore` prints exactly what it would run and exits —
a dry run, so you can confirm the target before overwriting it.

Backups are written to `<repo>/backups/memory/` by default (gitignored). Override
with `--out <dir>` or `MEMORY_BACKUP_DIR`. **Copy them off the box** — a backup
sitting on the same volume as the database does not survive losing that volume.

## Railway

Two layers, used together:

1. **Volume backups (platform-automatic, disk-level).** Your Postgres service
   stores data on a volume mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`. Enable
   Railway's scheduled backups/snapshots for that volume in the service settings
   so the disk is captured without any cron of your own. (See the `use-railway`
   skill or Railway's docs for the exact UI — features vary by plan.) This is the
   zero-maintenance baseline.
2. **Logical dumps (portable, the recommended primary).** A `pg_dump` is
   Postgres-version-independent and restores into any pgvector database, on
   Railway or elsewhere — the safer bet for a clean restore. Run it against the
   **public** proxy URL from your machine (SSL on by default):

   ```bash
   cd command-centre
   MEMORY_DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:PASSWORD@HOST.proxy.rlwy.net:PORT/agentic_memory' \
     npm run memory:backup -- --keep 14
   ```

   To run it *inside* Railway against the private URL, set `PGSSLMODE=disable`
   (the private URL offers no SSL), the same as `memory:migrate`.

## VPS (Docker)

The repo's compose file runs Postgres as `aios-memory-postgres` with its data in
the `aios_memory_pgdata` volume. Back it up the same way:

```bash
cd command-centre
MEMORY_DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/agentic_memory' \
PGSSLMODE=disable npm run memory:backup -- --keep 14
```

Then ship the file in `backups/memory/` off the host (object storage, another
server, `rsync`/`scp`). A backup that never leaves the box is not a backup.

### Schedule it (automatic)

`cron/jobs/nightly-memory-backup.md` runs `memory:backup -- --keep 14` nightly
through the managed cron runtime. It ships **inactive** — turn it on once a real
target and an off-box destination are in place:

1. Edit the job and set `active: 'true'` (and `MEMORY_DATABASE_URL` in the job's
   environment / `.env`).
2. `bash scripts/start-crons.sh` (or rely on the Command Centre server).
3. `bash scripts/status-crons.sh` to confirm it is scheduled.

`--keep 14` prunes to the 14 newest backups in the destination so the directory
does not grow without bound. Add an off-box copy step for true durability.

## Restore: failed deployment or bad migration

A backup only matters if the restore works. Two situations:

**Into a fresh, empty database** (lost host / new Railway service / new VPS):

```bash
cd command-centre
# 1. Provision a new pgvector Postgres and point MEMORY_DATABASE_URL at it.
# 2. Restore — recreates the extension, schema, and all rows from the dump.
npm run memory:restore -- backups/memory/agentic_memory_<ts>.dump --yes
# 3. Sanity-check the schema version and a search.
npm run memory:migrate -- --check
npm run memory:search -- "release process" --system
```

**Replace a broken state in place** (a bad migration left the live database
wrong). `--clean` drops and recreates objects before loading the dump:

```bash
npm run memory:restore -- backups/memory/agentic_memory_<ts>.dump --clean --yes
```

The restore target **must run a `pgvector/pgvector` image** — the dump recreates
the `vector` extension. Restoring onto plain Postgres fails with
`extension "vector" is not available`.

## Local PGLite

With no `MEMORY_DATABASE_URL` set, the store is local PGLite at
`.command-centre/memory`. `memory:backup` gzip-tars that directory and
`memory:restore` puts it back (moving the current one aside to
`.command-centre/memory.bak-<ts>` first):

```bash
cd command-centre
npm run memory:backup                                            # → pglite_memory_<ts>.tar.gz
npm run memory:restore -- backups/memory/pglite_memory_<ts>.tar.gz --yes
npm run memory:status                                            # counts match the backup
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---------|-------------|
| `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` not found | Install the Postgres client tools (`brew install libpq`, `apt-get install postgresql-client`). |
| Restore: `extension "vector" is not available` | The target is plain Postgres. Use a `pgvector/pgvector` image (same as the source). |
| `this is a Postgres dump (.dump), but no hosted database is configured` | Set `MEMORY_DATABASE_URL` to the target database before restoring a `.dump`. |
| `pg_restore` exits non-zero on a populated database | Objects already exist. Restore into a fresh database, or re-run with `--clean`. |
| `server version mismatch` from `pg_dump` | Your client tools are older than the server. Install a `pg_dump` matching the server's major version. |
| SSL errors (`no encryption` / `does not support SSL`) | Set `PGSSLMODE` — `require`/`no-verify` for TLS, `disable` for a Railway private URL. |
| `Embedding dimension mismatch` after restore | The dump was built at a different dimension. Current memory uses BGE-M3 at 1024 dimensions; rebuild and reindex with `scripts/setup-memory.sh` or `scripts/setup-memory.ps1`. |
