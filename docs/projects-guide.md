# Working on Projects

Not everything is a single task. When you have a larger piece of work — a product launch, a content series, a website overhaul — you need a way to scope it, track it, and keep context across sessions.

There are three levels. When you tell Claude your goal, it helps you pick the right one.

---

## The Three Levels

| Level | Name | When | Where |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| **1** | Single task | One or a few small deliverables | `projects/{category}/` |
| **2** | Planned project | Multi-deliverable, cross-session — campaigns, launches | `projects/briefs/{project-name}/` |
| **3** | GSD project | Complex multi-phase with dependencies | `projects/briefs/{project-name}/` + `.planning/` |

**"Your working folder"** = the root `agentic-os/` folder for solo/system-wide work, or `clients/client-name/` for client-specific work. All paths are relative to wherever you `cd`'d.

---

## Level 1: Single Task

Just ask Claude. Output goes to `projects/{category}-{type}/`. No brief, no project folder. Use Shift+Tab twice for plan mode if upfront thinking helps.

```
projects/mkt-copywriting/2026-03-24_blog-post.md
```

---

## Level 2: Planned Project

For multi-deliverable work — campaigns, launches, client deliverables. Claude runs a short scoping conversation (goal, deliverables, acceptance criteria, timeline) and writes a `brief.md`.

The project gets its own folder under `projects/briefs/`. ALL outputs for that project go inside it — not scattered across category folders. Projects are listed most-recent-first (by `created` date in frontmatter) when reporting to the user.

```
projects/briefs/q2-product-launch/   <- project folder
├── brief.md                         <- scope, deliverables, acceptance criteria
├── 2026-03-24_landing-page.md       <- outputs live WITH the brief
├── 2026-03-25_email-sequence.md
└── 2026-03-22_competitor-scan.md
```

### What goes in the brief

Claude scopes the project by asking:
- What's the goal? (one sentence)
- What are the deliverables? (checklist)
- How will you know it's done? (acceptance criteria)
- Any timeline or constraints?

The brief is saved as `projects/briefs/{project-name}/brief.md` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
project: q2-product-launch
status: active
level: 2
created: 2026-03-24
---
```

---

## Level 3: GSD Project

For complex multi-phase work with dependencies and milestones.

GSD uses a `.planning/` folder at the root of each workspace to store its roadmap, requirements, phase plans, and state. For client work, this lives inside the client folder — `clients/client-name/.planning/`. The root `agentic-os/` folder should never have `.planning/`; keeping it clean is what allows multiple clients to run GSD projects in parallel.

Your project's outputs and brief live in `projects/briefs/{project-name}/` inside the same workspace.

```
clients/website-client/              <- client workspace
├── .planning/                       <- GSD working space (at client root)
│   ├── PROJECT.md
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── REQUIREMENTS.md
│   ├── ROADMAP.md
│   ├── STATE.md
│   └── phases/
│       ├── 01-foundation/
│       └── 02-build/
└── projects/briefs/website-rebuild/ <- project outputs
    ├── brief.md
    ├── 2026-03-24_homepage-copy.md
    └── 2026-03-25_sitemap.excalidraw
```

### Multiple GSD projects in parallel

Each client workspace runs its own independent GSD project:

- **`clients/abc/`** → active GSD project at `clients/abc/.planning/`
- **`clients/xyz/`** → active GSD project at `clients/xyz/.planning/`

To start a GSD project for a client, select that client in the command-centre and ask Claude to run `/gsd-new-project`. GSD creates `.planning/` in the client workspace root automatically.

### Archiving a completed GSD project

When you're done with a GSD project, run `/archive-gsd`. This updates the brief's status to `complete` and leaves `.planning/` in place as a historical record. Start a new GSD project any time with `/gsd-new-project`.

## How It All Fits Together

```
projects/
├── mkt-copywriting/                <- single task category folder (Level 1)
│   └── 2026-03-20_blog-post.md
├── str-trending-research/          <- single task category folder
│   └── 2026-03-18_ai-trends.md
└── briefs/                         <- all Level 2/3 projects (most recent first)
    ├── kanban-dashboard/           <- Level 2 planned project (has brief.md)
    │   ├── brief.md
    │   └── 2026-03-24_architecture.md

        ├── brief.md
        ├── 2026-03-24_landing-page.md
        └── 2026-03-25_email-sequence.md

clients/
└── website-client/                 <- Level 3 GSD project lives inside a client workspace
    ├── .planning/                  <- GSD working space (at client root, never at agentic-os root)
    │   ├── PROJECT.md
    │   ├── config.json
    │   ├── REQUIREMENTS.md
    │   ├── ROADMAP.md
    │   ├── STATE.md
    │   └── phases/
    └── projects/briefs/
        └── website-rebuild/        <- project outputs
            ├── brief.md
            └── 2026-03-24_homepage-copy.md
```

**How to tell them apart:**
- Category folders live directly under `projects/` using `{category}-{type}` naming (e.g., `mkt-copywriting`) — no `brief.md` inside
- Project folders live under `projects/briefs/` with descriptive names (e.g., `kanban-dashboard`) — always have a `brief.md` inside
- When listing projects, most recent first (by `created` date in frontmatter)

The heartbeat scans for `brief.md` files inside `projects/briefs/*/` to find active projects.

---

## Session Memory and Projects

When you're working on a Level 2 or 3 project, each session's memory block (`context/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) includes a `### Project` field that links back to the project name. This means when Claude starts your next session and reads yesterday's memory, it automatically loads the project's `brief.md` for full context — you don't need to re-explain what you're working on.

For single tasks (Level 1), the project field is omitted and sessions work as before.

---

## Working Directory Matters

Be explicit about WHERE you work:

**Solo user or shared work:**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/agentic-os
claude
# "Start a project for Q2 product launch"
# -> Creates projects/briefs/q2-product-launch/brief.md
# -> All outputs go to projects/briefs/q2-product-launch/
```

**Client-specific projects:**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/agentic-os/clients/client-one
claude
# "Start a project for Q2 product launch"
# -> Creates projects/briefs/q2-product-launch/brief.md (inside client-one/)
# -> All outputs go to clients/client-one/projects/briefs/q2-product-launch/
```

The paths are always relative to your working directory. If you're in the wrong folder, outputs go to the wrong place. The heartbeat confirms which workspace you're in.

All three levels coexist. You might use Level 1 for daily requests, Level 2 for a campaign, and Level 3 for a website rebuild — all within the same workspace.
