You are running as a scheduled job for Agentic OS.

Read CLAUDE.md for system context.

Task: Check if any skills have been added or updated since the last check.

Steps:

1. Read `.claude/skills/_catalog/catalog.json` to get the full list of available skills.
2. Read `.claude/skills/_catalog/installed.json` to get what's currently installed.
3. List all folders in `.claude/skills/` to see what's actually on disk.
4. Compare:
   - Are there skills in the catalog that aren't installed? List them with a one-line description.
   - Are there installed skills whose folder is missing from disk? Flag these as broken.
5. Read `cron/status/skill-update-check.json` if it exists — compare today's catalog snapshot to the previous one to detect newly added catalog entries.

Save output to: projects/ops-cron/skill-update-check_{today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format}.md

Format:
- **New in catalog** — skills available but not installed (skip if none)
- **Not installed** — full list of uninstalled skills with descriptions
- **Issues** — any broken references or missing folders (skip if none)

If the catalog file doesn't exist or can't be read, note the error and exit without creating the output file.

If there are no new catalog entries, no broken references, and no issues found, end your response with `[SILENT]` on its own line. This suppresses the desktop notification since there's nothing to report.
