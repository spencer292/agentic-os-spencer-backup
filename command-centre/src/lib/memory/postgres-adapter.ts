/**
 * Memory Schema — hosted Postgres adapter & bootstrap.
 *
 * The hosted counterpart to pglite-adapter.ts: wraps a live node-postgres
 * connection as the engine-agnostic {@link SqlClient} that migrate.ts (and the
 * store) talk to. This is the "drop-in" the schema was designed for — one
 * schema, one SQL dialect, one vector engine across local PGLite and hosted
 * Postgres (see docs/memory/memory-schema.md and pglite-adapter.ts).
 *
 * IMPORTANT — a single connection, NOT a Pool. migrate.ts drives transactions
 * by issuing `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` as separate `exec()` calls. A
 * `pg.Pool` hands a different physical connection to each query, which would
 * scatter those statements across connections and silently break the
 * transaction. So this adapter pins one `pg.Client` for the lifetime of the
 * SqlClient. Concurrent, pooled access for the hosted server is handled
 * separately (see {@link openPostgresPool}); the migration runner and tests are
 * sequential and want exactly one connection.
 *
 * pgvector: unlike PGLite (where the WASM extension is registered at
 * construction), hosted Postgres ships pgvector in the image
 * (pgvector/pgvector:pgNN) and the migration's own
 * `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` enables it — so this adapter needs no
 * special vector setup. It is a thin passthrough, exactly like PGliteSqlClient.
