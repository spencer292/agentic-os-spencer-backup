/**
 * AIOS Memory Schema — scope invariants & the scoped-search WHERE builder.
 *
 * This module is the SINGLE source of the memory leak boundary. The DB CHECK
 * constraints in ./migrations/0001_init.sql enforce the same invariants at the
 * storage layer; this file enforces them in application code (defense in depth)
 * and builds the exact WHERE clause the scoped search runs. The
 * no-leak tests import this module so they cover the real filter,
 * not a copy of it.
 *
 * Scope rules (must match the DB CHECK exactly):
 *   private => userId   present
 *   client  => clientId present
 *   team    => teamId   present
 *   system  => baseline within a tenant (no extra column required)

 *   SELECT ... FROM memory_chunks
 *   WHERE ${sql} AND embedding IS NOT NULL
 *   ORDER BY embedding <=> $k LIMIT $k
 *
 * Leak-safety behavior:
 *  - The team predicate is ALWAYS emitted. A null teamId yields `team_id IS
 *    NULL` (local); a non-null teamId yields `team_id = $n`. Forgetting the
 *    team thus returns nothing in a hosted multi-team DB — never everything.
 *  - The `private` branch is emitted only when a userId is supplied (never
 *    `user_id = NULL`); the `client` branch only when a clientId is supplied.
 *  - `team` and `system` are included whenever present in `include`.
 *  - If no visibility branch is emitted, the block degrades to `FALSE`
 *    (match nothing) rather than matching everything.
 *
 * @param scope        who is asking
