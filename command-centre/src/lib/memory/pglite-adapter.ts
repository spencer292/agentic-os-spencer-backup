/**
 * AIOS Memory Schema — PGLite adapter & bootstrap.
 *
 * Wraps a live PGLite handle as the engine-agnostic {@link SqlClient} that
 * migrate.ts (and the store) talk to. Keeping the DB behind this thin interface
 * is what makes the schema "one shape for local PGLite and hosted Postgres":
 * a hosted `pg` adapter implements the same two methods and drops in with no
 * change to migrate.ts, scope.ts, or store.ts.
 *
 * The PGLite API already matches the interface closely — `query(sql, params)`
 * returns `{ rows }` and `exec(sql)` runs multiple statements — so the adapter
 * is a passthrough. The `vector` extension is registered at construction time
 * (pgvector cannot be loaded with a runtime `CREATE EXTENSION` unless the WASM
 * module is present), per docs/memory/memory-schema.md.
